## SOLID Principles Examples in PHP

### Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

### Open Closed Principle
A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification. 

### Liskov Substitution Principle
Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

### Interface Segregation Principle
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

### Dependency Inversion Principle
Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.
